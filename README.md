# Brackeys First Game in C# with Basic Multiplayer

> This example is in progress and does not currently work properly. See the remaining GitHub Issues to complete.

This is a fork of [the C# version of Brackeys first Godot project](https://github.com/brackeys-godot-csharp/first-game-in-godot) with an added basic multiplayer implementation ported from https://github.com/BatteryAcid/first-game-in-godot/.

Uses MultiplayerSynchronizer, MultiplayerSpawner, and RPCs to sync player position, animation, and the moving platform in the game.
